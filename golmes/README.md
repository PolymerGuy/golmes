<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot](use.png)

This tool can be used for parametric optimization via any software that supports inpufiles. We do this by first identifying keywords in a template file which will be
replaced by the arguments that we wish to treat as optimization variables.

The inputfile is then generates and passed into a pipeline defined by a series of calls.

The output is then parsed and compared to the desired response. Based on how well the results match the desired ones, the loop is repeated using new parameters.

What can it do:
* Multivariate optimization on non-differentiable problems where the software is interfaced by inputfiles

What it does not:
* Well... other things

The algorithms included in this software are not the fanciest you will find, but are proven general purpose algorithms.
This project is a composition of the wonderfull works of other people and I am just providing the infrastructure. See the following for a list of nice projects:

### Built With

* [Gonum](https://github.com/gonum)
* [Yamlparser](https://github.com/go-yaml/yaml)
